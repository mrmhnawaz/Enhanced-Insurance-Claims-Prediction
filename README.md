# Enhanced Insurance Claims Prediction (Accuracy: 32%)

This project focuses on predicting insurance claims using machine learning techniques.  
It was developed in **Google Colab** as part of a data analytics and machine learning practice project.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a predictive model for insurance claim prediction.  
We apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a claim will be made.
